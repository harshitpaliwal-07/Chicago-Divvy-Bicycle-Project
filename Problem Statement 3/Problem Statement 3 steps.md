Steps taken to solve the problem statement:

Step 1: Import the Primary Quarterly Dataset of the year 2017,2018 & 2019. Analyze the data using PS DataAnalysis.r. 

Step 2: Preparing the dataset as per the problem statement using PS3PreapreData1.r.

Step 3: Merging the weather Dataset prepared from the DarkSky API and the Bike availability data from the RScorata API using PS3PrepareData2.r and PS3PrepareData.py.

Step 4: Cleaning and Normalizing the Dataset.

Step 5: Plotting some graphs and maps for data visualization.

Step 6: Creating the Train(2017-18) and Test(2019) datatset. Target Variable: Maintenance (0 or 1) i.e Yes or No. Independent variable: Available bikes on particular date, weather icon, Totalduration of trip covered by the bike, No of Trips of the bike, Maintenance Date.

Step 7: Running 3 Algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

Step 8: Tuning the hyperparameters.

Step 9: Calculating Accuracy, Precison for model validation.

Step 10 (Conclusion): Decision Tree provides the highest accuracy and precision. And Hence is the best model.
