# Chicago-Divvy-DPA-Project
Predicting the need of bikes according to season in Chicago in order to ensure that the customers do not have to wait for more bikes, by ensuring the increase or decrease in the number or bikes at the docking station to maintain the profit.

Steps taken to solve the problem statement:

Step 1:
Creating the Weather Dataset 2017-19 using Dark Sky API in R.

Step 2:
Creating the Available Bikes 2017-2019 using RSocrata API in R.

Step 3:
Merging the Divvy Trip Quarterly Data into 2017-2019 data in R.

Step 4:
Cleaning the Dataset.

Step 5:
Plotting some graphs and maps for data visualization.

Step 6:
Creating the Train(2017-18) and Test(2019) datatset.

Step 7:
Running 4 Algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and ElasticNet Regression.

Step 8:
Calculating RMSE on Test Data and comparing the values.

Step 9:
ElasticNet proves to be most accurate model amongst the four models.
